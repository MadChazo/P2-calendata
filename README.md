## Description

This application was created as a group project for the University of Richmond coding boot camp. The task was to work together to create a web application that would serve a useful purpose using an Express backend with a MySQL database accessed through Sequelize. We also needed to incorporate authentication, at least GET and POST routes, and use Handlebars as a template engine. While working on this project, we learned about the benefits and drawbacks of collaborating on a larger-scale project than those we usually create in class and the trials and tribulations of getting many disparate parts of an application to synchronize and work in harmony.

## Usage

When accessing the site for the first time, you will be prompted to sign up for an account. Make sure to remember your credentials! After you input the information requested, including choosing categories of events you are interested in, you will be logged in and you should (theoretically) see your homepage with all of the events in your chosen categories for the next 28 days. You can then (theoretically) sort events by month, user who created it, or category. At the bottom of the event display, there is a button to add an event. You can fill in all the details for your event, and it will be added to the calendar. 

Some of the intended features of this application may be missing or broken, and for that we apologize.
