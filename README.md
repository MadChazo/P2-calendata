## Description

This application was created as a group project for the University of Richmond coding boot camp. The task was to work together to create a web application that would serve a useful purpose using an Express backend with a MySQL database accessed through Sequelize. We also needed to incorporate authentication, at least GET and POST routes, and use Handlebars as a template engine. While working on this project, we learned about the benefits and drawbacks of collaborating on a larger-scale project than those we usually create in class and the trials and tribulations of getting many disparate parts of an application to synchronize and work in harmony.
